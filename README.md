## 🧠 How It Works

- The app initializes with a list of movies (static/mock data for now)
- Each movie card contains:
1. Title
2. Description
3. Rating component with interactive stars
- Users can hover/select the number of stars to rate a movie

## ✨ Future Improvements

- 🔗 Fetch data dynamically from an API (e.g., TMDB or OMDb)
- 🧠 Store user ratings using localStorage or a backend
- 🔐 Add authentication so users can save/view ratings
- 🎭 Add filtering by genre or rating range
